# ADHD Classification Using Resting-State fMRI Data

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a neuroimaging analysis project focused on classifying Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using functional connectivity patterns derived from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. The analysis employs machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to differentiate individuals with ADHD from typically developing controls based on their brain connectivity profiles.


## Introduction
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting millions of children and adolescents worldwide. Diagnosing ADHD is challenging due to its multifaceted nature, which includes symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective assessments and behavioral observations, leading to variability in diagnosis accuracy.

This study aims to leverage machine learning techniques to improve ADHD diagnosis by analyzing functional connectivity patterns derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. Resting-state fMRI captures spontaneous brain activity in the absence of explicit tasks, providing insights into the intrinsic functional organization of the brain. By analyzing connectivity patterns between different brain regions, we can identify biomarkers that distinguish individuals with ADHD from typically developing controls.

## Setup
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Download the ADHD-200 dataset from the provided link and place it in the designated directory.

## Usage
The analysis pipeline involves several steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Remove noise and artifacts from rs-fMRI data using standard preprocessing techniques such as motion correction, slice timing correction, and spatial normalization.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Extract connectivity features from preprocessed rs-fMRI data. This can involve computing correlation matrices between brain regions, extracting graph theory metrics, or applying dimensionality reduction techniques.
3. **Model Training:** Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the extracted features to differentiate between individuals with ADHD and typically developing controls.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the classification performance of the SVM model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
5. **Optimization:** Explore advanced machine learning algorithms and feature selection techniques to improve classification accuracy and generalization performance.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the ADHD-200 dataset, a publicly available collection of rs-fMRI data from individuals with ADHD and typically developing controls. The dataset includes preprocessed functional MRI scans and accompanying phenotypic information, such as age, gender, and diagnostic labels.


## Results
The SVM model achieved moderate accuracy in differentiating individuals with ADHD from typically developing controls, demonstrating the potential of machine learning-based approaches for computational diagnosis. However, further research is needed to explore advanced algorithms and feature selection techniques to enhance classification performance and generalizability.

## Code Explanation

1. **Import Libraries**: Necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning modeling are imported.

2. **Data Acquisition**: Data provided by the ADHD 2000 project is used, including resting-state fMRI images, phenotypic information (including ADHD diagnosis, ADHD symptom measures, age, sex, etc.), and confound files for data preprocessing.

3. **Explore Target Variable (Y)**: Phenotypic data is loaded into a DataFrame, and exploratory analysis is conducted to understand the distribution of the dependent variable, which in this case is the presence or absence of ADHD (0 = control, 1 = ADHD).

4. **Load Brain Atlas**: A predefined brain atlas (ALL atlas) is loaded, dividing the brain into regions of interest (ROIs) for connectivity analysis.

5. **Feature Extraction with Nilearn Masker**: The Nilearn masker is used to extract functional connectivity features from each subject's brain. This involves calculating a correlation matrix between the signals from brain ROIs. This provides a list of correlation matrices, one per subject, representing the functional connectivity features of fMRI.

6. **Prepare Data for Machine Learning**: Data is split into training and testing sets, ensuring similar distributions of target classes (ADHD vs. control) in both sets.

7. **Train the Model**: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model is trained using hyperparameter search to find the best parameters.

8. **Evaluate Model Performance**: The model is evaluated on the test set using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the confusion matrix is visualized to better understand the model's performance.

9. **Interpret Feature Importance**: Feature importance is analyzed using SVM model coefficients, and the most relevant brain connections for ADHD prediction are visualized.



**Hypothesis**:
This project investigates whether it is possible to predict Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The underlying hypothesis is that there are patterns of brain connectivity that differ between individuals with ADHD and those without the disorder. It is proposed that by analyzing these connectivity patterns, especially in specific brain regions, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between individuals with and without ADHD can be developed.
